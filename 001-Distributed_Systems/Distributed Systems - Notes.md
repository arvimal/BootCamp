# Distributed Systems - Notes

**These are notes on Distributed Systems, mainly written while studying the topic.**

## 1. Introduction


## 2. Types of Distributed Systems


## 3. How Distributed Systems work?



## 4. Algorithms 

### 4.1. PAXOS 

PAXOS is a suite of algorithms that is commonly used for agreeing on something, in Distributed Systems.

Ceph uses PAXOS to agree upon consensus for the Monitor nodes. 

And I should say that **QOwnNotes** works really well, synced with DropBox.

`
	#!/usr/bin/env python3
	
	import calendar
	
	cal = calendar.TextCalendar(calendar.SUNDAY)
	
	print(cal.formatyear(2018))
`
