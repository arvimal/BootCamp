Operating System Concepts
==========================

# 1. System Programming

Notes taken while studying Operating System concepts, with a focus on Unix/Linux systems.

## 1.1. System Calls

System Calls or `syscalls` are function calls made from user-space, in order to avail a feature from the Kernel.

Examples include a text editor reading/writing to a file on a filesystem within a disk. The disk requires a firware driver, a generic top-level driver such as SCSI, a filesystem driver etc.. which are all dealt within the kernel land.

All the system calls are documented under section 2 of the Linux manual pages. In order to read an introduction, please try:

```bash
# man 2 intro
```

To list all the system calls available on a Linux/Unix machine, execute:

```bash
# man syscalls
# man 2 syscalls
```

System calls may differ between system architecture, but in Linux a large percentage is common between varying architectures.

### 1.1.1. Issuing System calls

User-space applications are restricted from accessing the kernel space as they wish, in order to impose security. A system call is required for user-space programs to avail features from the kernel.

The kernel presents a series of functions or hooks into its features, so that user-space applications can invoke them as per requirement.

For example, a user-space application wanting to read a file will have to use the `open()` syscall, followed with the `read()` syscall, to read a stream of data from the file.

The kernel provides a mechanism to initiate these syscalls, from user-space. The application can then execute the required function which is usually only allowed in kernel space. The kernel allows nothing more or less than the feature allowed by that specific syscall.

On **i386 architectures**, the following happens:

1. The user-space application loads the syscall ID to the register `%eax`.
2. The required parameters are loaded in `%ebx`, `%ecx`, `%edx`, `%esi`, and `%edi` registers.
3. The user-space application executes the software interrupt **int 0x80**.
4. The interrupt tells the processor to switch to kernel space, for that application.
5. The kernel reads the `%eax` register and executes the respective syscall.
6. The result is returned to the user-space application.

In case the syscall require more than five parameters, a single register such as `ebx` is used to point to a buffer space where all the parameters are loaded.

---

**NOTE:**

* `int` means **interrupt**, and `0x80` the interrupt number.
* The interrupt is transferred to the entity handling that specific interrupt.
* In Linux, the interrupt `0x80` is handled by the kernel and is used to initiate system calls by user-space applications/programs.
* The kernel expects the system-call ID in the `%eax` register.

## 1.2. The C library

## 1.3. The C compiler

# 2. APIs and ABIs

## 2.1. APIs

## 2.2. ABIs

Application Binary Interface (API) deals with the binary interfaces on a specific architecture.

ABI defines the following:

  * How an application interact with itself.
  * How an application interact with the kernel.
  * How an application interact with the libraries.

ABI makes sure the below specifications are met properly:

  * Byte ordering
  * Use of Processor registers
  * Linking with libraries
  * Binary-object format.
  * Invocation of system calls.

# 3. Abstraction

Abstraction is a very important concept in Linux and System programming in general.

Any difficult concept can be easily represented with an abstraction layer on top of it.

The most commonly used abstraction models in Unix/Linux are:

* Files
* Process
* Users, Groups, and Permissions

## 3.1. Files and file systems

* The most basic abstraction in a Unix/Linux system.
* Linux adheres to the theme of `everything-is-a-file` philosophy.
* Most interactions are through reading/writing to a file, even though the destination may not always be a proper file.
* Files are opened for reading, writing, or both, and is referenced by a file-descriptor.
* A file-descriptor is a handle pointing to a location in memory (address space).
* The file-descriptors are unique at any time.
* File-descriptors are shared with user-space, and can be accessed by applications/programs.

### 3.1.1. Regular files

* A regular file in Linux, is a stream of bytes (A linear array called Byte-Stream)
* Beyond the stream of byte format, Linux does not specify any standards.
*

### 3.1.2. Directories

### 3.1.3. Hard Links

### 3.1.4. Soft Links / Symbolic Links

### 3.1.5. Special files
  * Block device files
  * Character device files
  * Sockets
  * Pipes

### 3.1.6. Namespaces

## 3.2. Processes

## 3.3. Users and Groups

## 3.4. Permissions

## 3.5. Signals

Signals are process-level interrupt requests.

Signals can be sent among:

* Between processes
* Sent through the terminal driver to kill, interrupt, suspend etc.. [Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Z etc.]
* Sent by an administrator using the `kill` command.
* Sent by the kernel to processes if they do something unexpected.
* Sent by the kernel to notify processes on something specific.
  * Example: The kernel sending `SIGCHLD` to the parent process if a child process dies.

**NOTE:**
>Signals that cannot be STOPPED, BLOCKED, OR IGNORED.
>  * SIGKILL - 9
>  * SIGSTOP - 17

### 3.5.1. Common signals and their behavior
* **HUP** [signal 1] has two common interpretations.
  * First, it’s understood as a reset request by many daemons. If a daemon is capable of rereading its configuration file and adjusting to changes without restarting, a HUP can generally trigger this behavior.
  * Second, HUP signals are sometimes generated by the terminal driver in an attempt to “clean up” (i.e., kill) the processes attached to a particular terminal. This behavior is largely a holdover from the days of wired terminals and modem connections, hence the name “hangup.”
* **INT** [signal 2] is sent by the terminal driver when the user presses <Control-C>.
    * It’s a request to terminate the current operation.
    * Simple programs should quit (if they catch the signal) or simply allow themselves to be killed, which is the default if the signal is not caught.
    * Programs that have interactive command lines (such as shells) should stop what they’re doing, clean up, and wait for user input again.
* **KILL** [signal 9] is unblockable and terminates a process at the kernel level.
  * A process can never actually receive or handle this signal.

* **TERM** [signal 15] is a request to terminate execution completely.
  * It’s expected that the receiving process will clean up its state and exit.
* **QUIT** is similar to TERM, except that it defaults to producing a core dump if not caught.
  * A few programs cannibalize this signal and interpret it to mean something else.
* **SIGCHLD** -
### 3.5.2. Handler Routines

Using a handler routine, a process can act as required upon receiving a signal.

Specifying a handler routine for a signal is referred to as `Catching the signal`.

Depending upon how it's configured, either one of the following can happen if a process receives a signal:
  * Run the handler routine, if a handler routine has been configured.
  * The kernel takes a default action on behalf of the process.

## 3.6. Interprocess Communication
