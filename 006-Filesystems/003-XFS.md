Explain **Stripe unit** and **Stripe width** wrt to an XFS filesystem ?

* The mkfs.xfs binary can get the geometry of the lvm/md/evm etc.. layers. So in any of these cases, mkfs.xfs will fetch the underlying geometry from these layers.

* But for a hardware raid setup, mkfs.xfs won't be able to get these details from the raid controller. In such a case, the stripe unit and stripe width should be mentoned at filesystem creation.

##### Stripe Unit:

* Stripe unit is the actual stripe value of the raid array. ie.. the amount of data that can be written to a leg in a single go. This depends on the raid array, and can be 64K, 128K, 256K etc..
* Stripe unit can be either in the actual stripe size (64K, 128K, 256K etc..) or in blocks.
    * Blocks can be got by dividing the stripe size by the block size (4K usually). ie.. For a 64K stripe size, the number of blocks can be 64K/4K=16.

* So we can either use:

~~~
# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 -d su=64k,sw=10 /dev/sda1
~~~

OR
~~~
# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 -d su=16, sw=10 /dev/sda1
~~~

##### Stripe Width

Stripe width is the number of data disks in a single round-trip. If there are 12 disks in RAID6, you have 10 data disks and 2 parity disks (RAID6 has 2 parities). So sw would be 10 in this case.

NOTE:
xfs_info prints the su and sw information in blocks. So even if we used a byte size (64k, 128K etcc..) with mkfs.xfs, it would show the number of blocks in xfs_info.

~~~
# mkfs.xfs -f -i size=512 -n size=8192 -d su=256k,sw=10 /dev/vdd1
meta-data=/dev/vdd1              isize=512    agcount=8, agsize=31936 blks
         =               sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=0
data             =               bsize=4096   blocks=255488, imaxpct=25
         =               sunit=64     swidth=640 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=8192   ascii-ci=0
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=1472, version=2
         =               sectsz=512   sunit=64 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
~~~

Here even if su=256K, the sunit is printed in blocks. ie.. su/bsize = 256K/4K = 64.

NOTE: sw would be shown as a multiple of su (in blocks), ie.. 'su x 10' = 640


* XFS supports shared Copy-On-Write from RHEL8 onwards
  * This enables it to share the common data blocks between multiple files.
  * Updating any one file breaks the link of that file to the common data blocks and a new copy is created.
  * Shared COW is fast and space-efficient
  * RHEL7 can only mount XFS filesystems with shared COW, in read-only mode.
