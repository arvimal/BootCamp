Q) What are stripe unit and stripe width in an XFS filesystem ?

* The mkfs.xfs binary can get the geometry of the lvm/md/evm etc.. layers. So in any of these cases, mkfs.xfs will fetch the underlying geometry from these layers.

* But for a hardware raid setup, mkfs.xfs won't be able to get these details from the raid controller. In such a case, the stripe unit and stripe width should be mentoned at filesystem creation.

##### Stripe Unit:
* Stripe unit is the actual stripe value of the raid array. ie.. the amount of data that can be written to a leg in a single go. This depends on the raid array, and can be 64K, 128K, 256K etc..
* Stripe unit can be either in the actual stripe size (64K, 128K, 256K etc..) or in blocks.
    * Blocks can be got by dividing the stripe size by the block size (4K usually). ie.. For a 64K stripe size, the number of blocks can be 64K/4K=16.
* So we can either use:

# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 -d su=64k,sw=10 /dev/sda1
OR
# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 -d su=16, sw=10 /dev/sda1


##### Stripe Width:
Stripe width is the number of data disks in a single round-trip. If there are 12 disks in RAID6, you have 10 data disks and 2 parity disks (RAID6 has 2 parities). So sw would be 10 in this case.

NOTE:
xfs_info prints the su and sw information in blocks. So even if we used a byte size (64k, 128K etcc..) with mkfs.xfs, it would show the number of blocks in xfs_info.

# mkfs.xfs -f -i size=512 -n size=8192 -d su=256k,sw=10 /dev/vdd1
meta-data=/dev/vdd1              isize=512    agcount=8, agsize=31936 blks
         =               sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=0
data             =               bsize=4096   blocks=255488, imaxpct=25
         =               sunit=64     swidth=640 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=8192   ascii-ci=0
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=1472, version=2
         =               sectsz=512   sunit=64 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0


Here even if su=256K, the sunit is printed in blocks. ie.. su/bsize = 256K/4K = 64.
NOTE: sw would be shown as a multiple of su (in blocks), ie.. 'su x 10' = 640

Chat with Dustin Black (Senior TAM for RHS) to discuss stripe width and stripe unit:

<vimal> dblack hello
<vimal> i was reading the article https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/454523 you had written
<vimal> the raid/lvm/filesystem suggestions for rhs
<vimal> here, the su value for mkfs.xfs is what I'm looking for
<dblack> What's the question?
<vimal> as per the article , we'll have to multiply the raid stripe value with the block size, so for a RAID6 with 12 disks and 64K stripe size, the su value would be 64x4K=256K ..
<vimal> or do we just put in the actual raid stripe unit in 'su'?
<dblack> The stripe unit and width of xfs should match the underlying RAID layout for best performance
<vimal> dblack yes, i was trying to understand what we need to put in for a RAID6 for 12 disks..
<dblack> So here we're assuming a 256k RAID stripe and 12 disks, but with RAID 6 2 disks are effectively parity, so we use a width of 10
<vimal> the raid array has 64K stripe size
<vimal> I understand the sw would be 10.. i was a bit doubtful on su value
<dblack> So the XFS su in the example is set to 256k to match the RAID stripe
<vimal> dblack so if the raid stripe size is 64K , we should be using 'su=64'?
<vimal> i mean, su=64k
<dblack> Right, you need to specify 64k, otherwise it's interpreted as blocks
<dblack> you'd have to use su=16 or su=64k
<dblack> So the way you said it initially wasn't right: "multiply the raid stripe value with the block size, so for a RAID6 with 12 disks and 64K stripe size, the su value would be 64x4K=256K"
<vimal> aah!!! the customer would kill me :(
<dblack> you would actually divide the RAID stripe by the block size, or just use the su=64k shortcut
<dblack> ;)
<vimal> i misinterpreted the article
<dblack> Yeah, that's a really confusing bit and was hard to communicate clearly
<vimal> i get it now
<vimal> so http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/205320 should be correct
<vimal> i think we have to add the points "divide the RAID stripe by the block size, or just use the su=64k shortcut"
<vimal> in the article
<dblack> Yeah, and you see that the output shows the su and sw in blocks, so 16 and 160 respectively
<vimal> dblack thanks a lot.. really appreciate this
<dblack> and sw is extra confusing in that output because it's actually the su x sw
<vimal> but what i understood was 'sw = the total number of data disks in the array for a single round-trip of writes"
<vimal> ie.. from disk 1 to disk 12 in raid6, two goes for parity, hence 10 disks for data.. so sw=10
<vimal> isnt that correct?
<dblack> yeah, it's correct, but it's just goofy the way xfs interprets it and shows the result
<dblack> you pass it as a multiple, so 10, but the output gives you the multiplied value
<vimal> yes, its super confusing
<vimal> dblack thank you once again..
